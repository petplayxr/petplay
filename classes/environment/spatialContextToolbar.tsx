 * panel's *frame*; this is a floating contextual surface whose content varies
 * with the node in focus, so it takes the tokens and the recursive spacing and
 * radius rules without the fixed layout.
 *
 * Widths still snap to the slot grid: actions span a whole number of slots and
 * two fit per row, so the card's right edge is straight no matter how long the
 * labels are. That is the rule that keeps an otherwise rigid system from
 * reading as loose.

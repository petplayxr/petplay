# Track 7: Stack update

Bring the rendering and interaction stack up to current versions before optimizing the CPU path
([track 3](./stability-performance.md)). Profiling and tuning against old internals is wasted
work once they change.

## Today (2026-10-11)

| Package | Pinned | Current upstream |
|---|---|---|
| `@react-three/fiber` | `10.0.0-alpha.2` (`classes/r3fWebgpuCompat.ts`) | `10.0.0-alpha.5`; canaries daily (`10.0.0-canary.*`); stable is 9.8.1 |
| `three` | jsdelivr commit `30e9dd1b` (`deno.json`), lock has 0.184.0 | 0.186.1 |
| `@pmndrs/xr` / `handle` / `pointer-events` | fork `mommysgoodpuppy/xr`, 2026-09-20 (has our one-hand-scaling HandleStore work) | upstream pmndrs/xr |
| `@pmndrs/uikit` | upstream, 2026-05-06 | upstream main |
| IWER | fork `mommysgoodpuppy/immersive-web-emulation-runtime` 2.2.0, 2026-05-11 | upstream |
| `react` | 19.2.5 | — |

All of these come in through the `submodules/threewebxrwebgpudeno` workspace member.

## Plan

1. r3f → newest v10 prerelease (alpha.5 or a pinned canary). Re-check the compat shim
   (`r3fWebgpuCompat.ts`: legacy `useFrame` with `XRFrame`, `state.clock`), which tracks the v10
   scheduler API.
2. three → 0.186.x. Re-verify raythree extraction (`submodules/raythree`), since it reads three
   internals, and the TSL materials.
3. Rebase the xr fork on upstream. Upstream the HandleStore changes if pmndrs will take them,
   so the fork gets smaller.
4. uikit and IWER → latest. Rebase the IWER fork's "extra mods".
5. After each step, run the playtest smoke + an `overlay:perf` capture and compare to the
   pre-update baseline, so a regression has one clear cause.

## Progress

- 2026-10-11: steps 1–2 done. r3f is on `10.0.0-alpha.5`, three on `0.186.1`, `@types/three`
  on 0.186. `three` now maps to `npm:three@0.186.1/*` instead of a jsdelivr URL. Before this,
  two three copies were loaded: r3f's npm peer (it created the `Scene`) and the jsdelivr build
  (everything else). Now there's one. A root `overrides` entry pins every npm consumer to the
  same version, and meshline is mapped to its ESM build so it stops `require`-ing the CJS three.
  `deno task check` went from 16 to 11 errors in our code (752 → 151 filtered). `overlay:perf`
  r3f avg went from about 0.48 to 0.55 ms per frame (likely the v10 scheduler; look at it in
  the perf pass).
  Server RSS went from about 344 to 313 MB.

## Done when

Everything is on current versions, the forks are rebased with their diff documented, and the
perf baseline is no worse than before the update.
